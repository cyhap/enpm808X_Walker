# HW 12 Notes
The teleop keyboard uses
 Topic: /cmd_vel_mux/input/teleop 
 to publish to
 Subscriber: /mobile_base_nodelet_manager
 
 The mobile_base_nodelet_manager publishes
  Topic: mobile_base/commands/velocity
  
 To /gazebo node.
 
 
 Seems like we would want control of either of those topics to control the turtle bot.
 
 Looking at the /mobile_base_nodelet_manager/bond topic the messages published on it mention cmd_vel_mux and bumper2pointcloud
 
 Those names make more sense to me in terms of components we might be interested in.
 
  THESE ARE THE TOPICS OF INTEREST
 * /mobile_base/commands/velocity [geometry_msgs/Twist]
 * /scan [sensor_msgs/LaserScan]

 Outline Steps to accomplish task:
  - Set a default linear velocity for the turtle bot.
  - Publish this velocity on the topic mentioned above.
  - Subscribe to the point cloud topic
  - Determine when a collision is immenent via the point cloud data
  - If a collision is imminent turn left or right until there is no collision immenent and continue on default linear velocity.
  
  
UPDATE PACKAGE.XML and CMAKE LIST:
  geometry_msgs/Twist
  sensor_msgs/LaserScan
  
  
TODO LIST:
  Consider adding a service to modify the min/max velocity that the robot moves.
  Investingate the velocity smoothing and impact on the publishing rate.

Notes:
  In the launch file use the following mapping: rosrun enpm808x_walker walker cmd_vel:=/mobile_base/commands/velocity 
   also maps to this and still works. /cmd_vel_mux/input/teleop
