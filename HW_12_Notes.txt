# HW 12 Notes
The teleop keyboard uses
 Topic: /cmd_vel_mux/input/teleop 
 to publish to
 Subscriber: /mobile_base_nodelet_manager
 
 The mobile_base_nodelet_manager publishes
  Topic: mobile_base/commands/velocity
  
 To /gazebo node.
 
 
 Seems like we would want control of either of those topics to control the turtle bot.
 
 Looking at the /mobile_base_nodelet_manager/bond topic the messages published on it mention cmd_vel_mux and bumper2pointcloud
 
 Those names make more sense to me in terms of components we might be interested in.
 
  THESE ARE THE TOPICS OF INTEREST
 * /mobile_base/commands/velocity [geometry_msgs/Twist]
 * /mobile_base/sensors/bumper_pointcloud [sensor_msgs/PointCloud2]

 Outline Steps to accomplish task:
  - Set a default linear velocity for the turtle bot.
  - Publish this velocity on the topic mentioned above.
  - Subscribe to the point cloud topic
  - Determine when a collision is immenent via the point cloud data
  - If a collision is imminent turn left or right until there is no collision immenent and continue on default linear velocity.
